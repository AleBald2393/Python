# Import Beautiful Soup to parse the web page content
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# Specify the URL of the webpage you want to scrape
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM'
# Send an HTTP GET request to the webpage
response = requests.get(url)
# Store the HTML content in a variable
html_content = response.text
# Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
# Display a snippet of the HTML content
print(html_content[:500])

# Find all <a> tags (anchor tags) in the HTML
links = soup.find_all('a')
# Iterate through the list of links and print their text
for the link in links:
    print(link.text)

Custom data extraction
Web scraping allows you to navigate the HTML structure and extract specific information based on your requirements. This process may involve finding specific tags, attributes, or text content within the HTML document.

Using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
Beautiful Soup is a powerful tool for navigating and extracting specific web page parts. It allows you to find elements based on their tags, attributes, or text, making extracting the information you're interested in easier.

Using pandas read_html for table extraction
Pandas, a Python library, provides a function called read_html, which can automatically extract data from websites' tables and present it in a format suitable for analysis. Itâ€™s similar to taking a table from a webpage and importing it into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
