Introduction
Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data on websites is unstructured, and web scraping enables us to convert it into a structured form.

Importance of Web Scraping in Data Science
In the field of data science, web scraping plays an integral role. It is used for various purposes such as:

Data Collection: Web scraping is a primary method of collecting data from the internet. This data can be used for analysis, research, etc.
Real-time Application: Web scraping is used for real-time applications like weather updates, price comparison, etc.
Machine Learning: Web scraping provides the data needed to train machine learning models.
                                                                                                            
                                      Python provides several libraries for web scraping. Here are some of them:
Beautiful Soup:
                                                                       from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
URL = "http://www.example.com"
page = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")

Scrapy:
import scrapy
class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes"
    start_urls = ['http://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/humor/',]
    def parse(self, response):
        for quote in response.css('div.quote'):
            yield {'quote': quote.css('span.text::text').get()}

  Selenium
  from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

Applications of Web Scraping
Web scraping is used in various fields and has many applications:

Price Comparison: Services such as ParseHub use web scraping to collect data from online shopping websites and use it to compare the prices of products.

Email address gathering: Many companies that use email as a medium for marketing, use web scraping to collect email ID and then send bulk emails.

Social Media Scraping: Web scraping is used to collect data from Social Media websites such as Twitter to find out what's trending.
