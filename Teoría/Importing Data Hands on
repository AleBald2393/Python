We utilize the pandas.read_csv() function for reading CSV files. However, in this version of the lab, which operates on JupyterLite, the dataset needs to be downloaded to the interface using the provided code below.

This dataset was hosted on IBM Cloud object. Click HERE for free storage.

The functions below will download the dataset into your browser:

from pyodide.http import pyfetch

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

To obtain the dataset, utilize the download() function as defined above:

await download(file_path, "auto.csv")
file_name="auto.csv"

Utilize the Pandas method read_csv() to load the data into a dataframe.

df = pd.read_csv(file_name)

After reading the data set, we can use the data_frame.head(n) method to check the top n rows of the data frame, where n is an integer. Contrary to data_frame.head(n), data_frame.tail(n) will show you the bottom n rows of the data frame.

# show the first 5 rows using dataframe.head() method
print("The first 5 rows of the dataframe") 
df.head(5)

Question #1: Â¶
Check the bottom 10 rows of data frame "df".

df.tail(10)

First, create a list "headers" that include all column names in order. Then, use dataframe.columns = headers to replace the headers with the list you created.

# create headers list
headers = ["symboling","normalized-losses","make","fuel-type","aspiration", "num-of-doors","body-style",
         "drive-wheels","engine-location","wheel-base", "length","width","height","curb-weight","engine-type",
         "num-of-cylinders", "engine-size","fuel-system","bore","stroke","compression-ratio","horsepower",
         "peak-rpm","city-mpg","highway-mpg","price"]
print("headers\n", headers)

Replace headers and recheck our data frame:
df.columns = headers
df.columns

You can also see the first 10 entries of the updated data frame and note that the headers are updated.
df.head(10)

Now, we need to replace the "?" symbol with NaN so the dropna() can remove the missing values:
df1=df.replace('?',np.NaN)

You can drop missing values along the column "price" as follows:
df=df1.dropna(subset=["price"], axis=0)
df.head(20)

Here, axis=0 means that the contents along the entire row will be dropped wherever the entity 'price' is found to be NaN

Now, you have successfully read the raw data set and added the correct headers into the data frame.
