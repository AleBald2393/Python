The advantages of using APIs:

Automation. Less human effort is required and workflows can be easily updated to become faster and more
productive.
Efficiency. It allows to use the capabilities of one of the already developed APIs than to try to independently implement some functionality from scratch.
The disadvantage of using APIs:

Security. If the API is poorly integrated, it means it will be vulnerable to attacks, resulting in data breeches or losses having financial or reputation implications.
