Import the dataset
You should download the modified version of the data set from the last module. Run the following code block to download the CSV file to this environment.

The functions below will download the dataset into your browser:

from pyodide.http import pyfetch

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

filepath="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-Coursera/laptop_pricing_dataset_mod2.csv"

await download(filepath, "laptops.csv")
file_name="laptops.csv"

Import the file to a pandas dataframe.

df = pd.read_csv(file_name, header=0)

Task 1 - Visualize individual feature patterns
Continuous valued features
Generate regression plots for each of the parameters "CPU_frequency", "Screen_Size_inch" and "Weight_pounds" against "Price". Also, print the value of correlation of each feature with "Price".

# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute
# CPU_frequency plot
Click here for Solution
sns.regplot(x="CPU_frequency", y="Price", data=df)
plt.ylim(0,)

# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute
# Screen_Size_inch plot
sns.regplot(x="Screen_Size_inch", y="Price", data=df)
plt.ylim(0,)

sns.regplot(x="Weight_pounds", y="Price", data=df)
plt.ylim(0,)

for param in ["CPU_frequency", "Screen_Size_inch","Weight_pounds"]:
    print(f"Correlation of Price and {param} is ", df[[param,"Price"]].corr())

Categorical features
Generate Box plots for the different feature that hold categorical values. These features would be "Category", "GPU", "OS", "CPU_core", "RAM_GB", "Storage_GB_SSD"

# Category Box plot
sns.boxplot(x="Category", y="Price", data=df)
