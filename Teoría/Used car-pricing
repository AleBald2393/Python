Linear Regression
One example of a Data Model that we will be using is:

Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a method to help us understand the relationship between two variables:

The predictor/independent variable (X)
The response/dependent variable (that we want to predict)(Y)
The result of Linear Regression is a linear function that predicts the response (dependent) variable as a function of the predictor (independent) variable.


Linear Function

a refers to the intercept of the regression line, in other words: the value of Y when X is 0
b refers to the slope of the regression line, in other words: the value with which Y changes when X increases by 1 unit

Let's load the modules for linear regression:
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Create the linear regression object:
lm = LinearRegression()
lm

X = df[['highway-mpg']]
Y = df['price']

Fit the linear model using highway-mpg:
lm.fit(X,Y)

We can output a prediction:
Yhat=lm.predict(X)
Yhat[0:5] 

What is the value of the intercept (a)?
lm.intercept_

What is the value of the slope (b)?
lm.coef_

Train the model using "engine-size" as the independent variable and "price" as the dependent variable?
lm1.fit(df[['engine-size']], df[['price']])
lm1

Question #1 d): 
What is the equation of the predicted line? You can use x and yhat or "engine-size" or "price".

Yhat=-7963.34 + 166.86*X

Price=-7963.34 + 166.86*df['engine-size']
